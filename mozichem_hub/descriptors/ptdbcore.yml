  TOOL1:
    NAME: search_component_for_thermodynamic_properties
    DESCRIPTION: This tool checks if the thermodynamic properties of a specified chemical component are available in the database. It returns a string indicating the availability status of the component's properties. Normally, it returns a list of available properties with its name, symbol, databook, and table name.
