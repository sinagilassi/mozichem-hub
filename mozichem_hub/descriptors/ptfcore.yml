  calc_bubble_pressure_ideal_vapor_ideal_liquid:
    NAME: calc_bubble_pressure_ideal_vapor_ideal_liquid
    DESCRIPTION: The Bubble-Pressure (BP) calculation determines the pressure at which the first bubble of vapor forms when a liquid mixture is heated at a constant temperature. It is used to find the pressure for a given temperature at which the liquid will begin to vaporize.
