    This MCP server provides tools for computing vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations using the Raoult's law and modified Raoult's law models.

    ðŸ”§ Available Tools:
    â€¢ `calc_bubble_pressure`
      â†’ Calculates the bubble pressure of a liquid mixture at a specified temperature using Raoult's law or modified Raoult's law.
  TOOL1:
    NAME: calc_bubble_pressure
    DESCRIPTION: The Bubble-Pressure (BP) calculation determines the pressure at which the first bubble of vapor forms when a liquid mixture is heated at a constant temperature. It is used to find the pressure for a given temperature at which the liquid will begin to vaporize.
