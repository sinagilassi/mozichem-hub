    This MCP server provides tools for computing thermodynamic fugacity using a variety of equations of state (EOS). It supports both component-level and mixture-level calculations in gas and liquid phases.

    ðŸ”§ Available Tools:
    â€¢ `calc_gas_component_fugacity`
      â†’ Calculates the fugacity of a gas-phase component at a given temperature and pressure.

    â€¢ `calc_liquid_component_fugacity`
      â†’ Calculates the fugacity of a liquid-phase component at a given temperature and pressure.

    â€¢ `calc_fugacity_gas_mixture`
      â†’ Computes the fugacity of a gas-phase mixture of components under specified conditions.

    ðŸ“¦ Backend:
    â€¢ Powered by the `PyThermoModels` package.
    â€¢ Implements the `MCP_PTMCore` class described in `ptmcore.yml`.

    ðŸ“Œ Usage Tips:
    â€¢ Inputs must include valid temperature, pressure, and composition data.
    â€¢ Each tool is independentâ€”call the one appropriate to your task.
    â€¢ Results are optimized for process modeling and engineering applications.
