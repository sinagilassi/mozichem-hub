    This MCP server provides tools for computing thermodynamic fugacity using a variety of equations of state (EOS). It supports both component-level and mixture-level calculations in gas and liquid phases.

    🔧 Available Tools:
    • `get_method_reference_inputs`
      → Retrieves the reference inputs required for a specific method, including data and equations.

    • `calc_gas_component_fugacity`
      → Calculates the fugacity of a gas-phase component at a given temperature and pressure.

    • `calc_liquid_component_fugacity`
      → Calculates the fugacity of a liquid-phase component at a given temperature and pressure.

    • `calc_fugacity_gas_mixture`
      → Computes the fugacity of a gas-phase mixture of components under specified conditions.

    • `component_eos_roots_analysis`
      → Analyzes the roots of the EOS for a single component at specified temperature and pressure

    • `multi_component_eos_roots_analysis`
      → Analyzes the roots of the EOS for a mixture of components at specified temperature and pressure.

    📦 Backend:
    • Powered by the `PyThermoModels` package.
    • Implements the `MCP_PTMCore` class described in `ptmcore.yml`.

    📌 Usage Tips:
    • Inputs must include valid temperature, pressure, and composition data.
    • Each tool is independent—call the one appropriate to your task.
    • Results are optimized for process modeling and engineering applications.
